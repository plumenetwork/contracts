## PlumeStaking System

### High-Level Architecture Overview

PlumeStaking is a Diamond proxy-based staking system that separates concerns across multiple facets. The system implements a delegated proof-of-stake mechanism where users stake PLUME tokens to validators and earn rewards in multiple ERC20 tokens.

**Core Design Principles:**
- **Diamond Pattern (EIP-2535)**: Modular architecture allowing selective upgrades without full redeployment
- **Checkpoint-Based Rewards**: Historical rate tracking enables accurate reward calculations across rate changes
- **Validator-Specific Accounting**: Each validator maintains independent reward rates and commission structures
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Rewards calculated on-demand rather than continuously updated
- **Separate Treasury**: Reward funds custody isolated from staking logic

**Key Mechanics:**
1. Users stake PLUME to validators, earning rewards based on validator-specific emission rates
2. Validators earn commission on generated rewards (configurable per validator, max 50%)
3. Unstaking initiates a cooldown period before funds become withdrawable
4. Slashing requires unanimous vote from all other active validators
5. All reward distributions flow through a separate treasury contract

**Initialization:**
```solidity
// After Diamond deployment, initialize PlumeStaking
plumeStaking.initializePlume(initialOwner, minStake, cooldown, maxSlashVoteDuration, maxValidatorCommission)

// Initialize AccessControlFacet
accessControlFacet.initializeAccessControl()
```

### Architecture

#### Diamond Pattern Implementation

PlumeStaking uses the EIP-2535 Diamond standard to organize functionality into modular facets:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[PlumeStaking Diamond Proxy] --> B[AccessControlFacet]
    A --> C[StakingFacet]
    A --> D[RewardsFacet]
    A --> E[ValidatorFacet]
    A --> F[ManagementFacet]
    D -.->|Distributes Rewards| G[PlumeStakingRewardTreasury]

    style A fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    style C fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    style D fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    style E fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    style F fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    style G fill:#ffc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
```

**Facet Responsibilities:**
- **AccessControlFacet**: OpenZeppelin AccessControl implementation
- **StakingFacet**: stake(), unstake(), withdraw(), restake(), restakeRewards()
- **RewardsFacet**: Reward calculation, distribution, treasury integration
- **ValidatorFacet**: Validator lifecycle, slashing, commission management
- **ManagementFacet**: System parameters, admin functions

#### Treasury System

The protocol separates fund custody from staking logic using a dedicated treasury contract:

```mermaid

    A[Users] -->|Stake PLUME| B[Diamond Proxy]
    B -->|Calculates Rewards| B
    B -->|Requests Distribution| C[Treasury Proxy]
    C -->|Delegates to| D[Treasury Implementation]
    D -->|Transfers Rewards| A
    
    style B fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#ffc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#cfc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
```

**Treasury Implementation:**
- UUPS upgradeable proxy pattern
- Role-based access (only Diamond can distribute)
- Multi-token support
- Direct transfers to users

### Core Concepts

#### Staking Mechanism

Staking lifecycle:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Liquid: User has PLUME
    Liquid --> Staked: stake()
    Staked --> Cooling: unstake()
    Cooling --> Liquid: withdraw() after cooldown
    Cooling --> Staked: restake()
    Staked --> Staked: restakeRewards()
```

**Implementation Details:**
- Global minimum stake amount check
- Per-validator capacity limits
- Validator must be active and not slashed
- stake() accepts msg.value, stakeOnBehalf() allows third-party staking
- Cooldown period prevents immediate withdrawals after unstaking

#### Reward Calculation System

The reward system uses a sophisticated checkpoint-based mechanism to handle variable rates, validator-specific multipliers, and commission deductions.

##### Core Components

**1. Validator-Level Rate Tracking**
The system tracks reward rates exclusively at the validator level. When a reward token is added or its rate is updated via `setRewardRates`, a rate checkpoint is created for *every* active validator. This ensures all reward calculations are based on a specific validator's rate history.

**2. Checkpoint Structure**
```solidity
struct RateCheckpoint {
    uint256 timestamp;       // When rate changed
    uint256 rate;           // New rate (tokens/second/staked token)
    uint256 cumulativeIndex; // Accumulated rewards up to this point
}
```

**3. Key Storage Mappings**
- `validatorRewardRateCheckpoints[validatorId][token]`: Rate history
- `validatorCommissionCheckpoints[validatorId]`: Commission history
- `validatorRewardPerTokenCumulative[validatorId][token]`: Accumulated rewards
- `userValidatorRewardPerTokenPaid[user][validatorId][token]`: User's last settled index

##### Calculation Algorithm

**Step 1: Time Segmentation**

When calculating rewards, the system identifies all rate change points:

```mermaid
gantt
    title Reward Calculation Timeline Example
    dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD
    axisFormat %m/%d

    section User Activity
    Stake 1000 PLUME         :milestone, 2024-01-01, 0d
    Claim Rewards            :milestone, 2024-01-30, 0d

    section Rate Changes
    Rate: 100/day (10% comm) :active, 2024-01-05, 10d
    Rate: 150/day (15% comm) :active, 2024-01-15, 10d
    Rate: 150/day (20% comm) :active, 2024-01-25, 5d
```

**Step 2: Segment Processing**

For each time segment between checkpoints:

```
Segment Gross Reward = Stake × Rate × Duration
Segment Commission = Gross Reward × Commission Rate
Segment Net Reward = Gross Reward - Commission
```

**Step 3: Mathematical Formula**

For a user with stake `S` over time period `[t₀, t₁]`:

```
Total Net Reward = Σᵢ [Sᵢ × Rᵢ × Δtᵢ × (1 - Cᵢ)]

Where:
- i = each time segment
- Sᵢ = stake amount in segment i
- Rᵢ = reward rate in segment i
- Δtᵢ = duration of segment i
- Cᵢ = commission rate in segment i
```

##### Detailed Calculation Example

**Setup:**
- User stakes 1,000 PLUME on January 1st
- REWARD_TOKEN with 18 decimals
- All rates use REWARD_PRECISION = 1e18

**Timeline:**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Jan 1<br/>Stake 1000] --> B[Jan 5<br/>Rate: 100/day<br/>Comm: 10%]
    B --> C[Jan 15<br/>Rate: 150/day<br/>Comm: 15%]
    C --> D[Jan 25<br/>Comm: 20%<br/>Rate unchanged]
    D --> E[Jan 30<br/>Claim]
    
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style E fill:#c8e6c9
```

**Checkpoint Creation:**

```javascript
// Reward Rate Checkpoints
Checkpoint 0: { 
    timestamp: Jan 5, 
    rate: 100e18,     // 100 tokens/day/staked token
    cumulativeIndex: 0 
}
Checkpoint 1: { 
    timestamp: Jan 15, 
    rate: 150e18, 
    cumulativeIndex: 1000e18  // Accumulated from previous segment
}

// Commission Checkpoints
Checkpoint 0: { timestamp: Jan 5,  rate: 0.1e18 }   // 10%
Checkpoint 1: { timestamp: Jan 15, rate: 0.15e18 }  // 15%
Checkpoint 2: { timestamp: Jan 25, rate: 0.2e18 }   // 20%
```

**Calculation Process:**

| Segment | Duration | Rate | Stake | Gross Rewards | Commission | Net Rewards |
|---------|----------|------|-------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| Jan 1-5 | 4 days | 0 | 1,000 | 0 | 0% | 0 |
| Jan 5-15 | 10 days | 100/day | 1,000 | 1,000,000 | 10% (100,000) | 900,000 |
| Jan 15-25 | 10 days | 150/day | 1,000 | 1,500,000 | 15% (225,000) | 1,275,000 |
| Jan 25-30 | 5 days | 150/day | 1,000 | 750,000 | 20% (150,000) | 600,000 |
| **Total** | | | | **3,250,000** | **475,000** | **2,775,000** |

##### Implementation Details

**1. Finding Relevant Checkpoints (Binary Search)**

```solidity
function findCheckpointIndex(checkpoints, timestamp) {
    uint256 low = 0;
    uint256 high = checkpoints.length - 1;
    
    while (low <= high) {
        uint256 mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (checkpoints[mid].timestamp <= timestamp) {
            if (mid == high || checkpoints[mid + 1].timestamp > timestamp) {
                return mid;  // Found the right checkpoint
            }
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

> *Note: The function above is a simplified example for illustrative purposes. The actual implementation in `src/lib/PlumeRewardLogic.sol` is more robust and uses specialized functions such as `findRewardRateCheckpointIndexAtOrBefore` and `findCommissionCheckpointIndexAtOrBefore` to handle edge cases.*

**2. Time Segment Generation**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Get User's Last Update Time] --> B[Get Current Time]
    B --> C[Find All Checkpoints Between]
    C --> D[Merge Reward & Commission Checkpoints]
    D --> E[Sort Unique Timestamps]
    E --> F[Create Time Segments]
    
    F --> G[Segment 1: T0 → T1]
    F --> H[Segment 2: T1 → T2]
    F --> I[Segment N: Tn-1 → Tn]
```

**3. Per-Segment Calculation Flow**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Segment Start] --> B[Get Rate at Start]
    B --> C[Get Commission at Start]
    C --> D[Calculate Duration]
    D --> E[Gross = Stake × Rate × Duration]
    E --> F[Commission = Gross × CommRate]
    F --> G[Net = Gross - Commission]
    G --> H[Add to Total]
```

**4. Precision Handling**

All calculations use REWARD_PRECISION (1e18) to maintain accuracy:

```solidity
// Rate stored as tokens per second with 1e18 precision
uint256 ratePerSecond = 100e18 / 86400;  // 100 tokens/day

// Calculation preserves precision
uint256 rewardPerToken = duration * ratePerSecond;
uint256 grossReward = (stake * rewardPerToken) / REWARD_PRECISION;
```

##### Edge Cases

**1. Validator Slashing**
- Rewards stop accruing at slashedAtTimestamp
- Existing unclaimed rewards remain claimable
- No new rewards after slash time

**2. Mid-Stake Rate Changes**
- New stakers start earning from their stake timestamp
- Rate changes don't affect past earnings
- Checkpoint index tracking prevents double-claiming

**3. Zero Rates**
- Supported for pausing rewards
- Checkpoints still created for consistency
- Previous rewards remain claimable

##### Gas Optimization

**1. Checkpoint Efficiency**
- Binary search reduces lookup from O(n) to O(log n)
- Checkpoints only created on rate changes
- User checkpoint indices tracked to avoid re-processing

**2. Batch Operations**
- `claimAll()` processes all tokens in one transaction
- Validator commission settled across all tokens simultaneously
- Single update for all user rewards per validator

This checkpoint-based system ensures perfect accuracy regardless of when users claim, while maintaining gas efficiency through optimized data structures and algorithms.

#### Reward Token Lifecycle & Historical Tokens

Plume supports adding and removing reward tokens without disrupting historical reward accuracy:

- **Adding a token** (`addRewardToken`) immediately pushes the token into `rewardTokens`, marks it `isRewardToken=true`, and creates an *initial* reward-rate checkpoint for **every validator** at the chosen `initialRate`.  The token is also appended to the immutable `historicalRewardTokens` list.
- **Removing a token** (`removeRewardToken`) does **not** delete checkpoints. Instead it:
  1. Records `tokenRemovalTimestamps[token] = block.timestamp` so future calculations cap at this moment.
  2. Forces a final **zero-rate checkpoint** for each validator, guaranteeing no further accrual.
  3. Leaves all historical checkpoints intact so users can still claim previously-earned rewards.
- Users can therefore continue to claim even after a token is no longer active.  View/claim helpers automatically fall back to historical calculations when `isRewardToken[token] == false` but `isHistoricalRewardToken[token] == true`.
- Administrative helpers exist to *manually* add or remove entries from the historical list (`addHistoricalRewardToken`, `removeHistoricalRewardToken`).  These functions were used to migrate the contract state from v1 to v2 version. 
- The events `HistoricalRewardTokenAdded` / `HistoricalRewardTokenRemoved` capture these changes for off-chain indexers.

#### Slashing Mechanism

Slashing is driven by **unanimous votes** from *all other active validators* and can execute in two ways:

1. **Auto-Slash (preferred)** – when the last required validator casts its vote via `voteToSlashValidator`, the contract immediately calls the internal `_performSlash` and the validator is slashed in the *same* transaction. No privileged role is needed.
2. **Timed Slash** – if unanimity was reached but the auto-slash failed (e.g., a re-org removed a vote) anyone with `TIMELOCK_ROLE` may call `slashValidator` to perform the slash once the vote set is valid.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    V["Validator Admins"] -->|"voteToSlashValidator"| S["Slash Votes"]
    S -->|"Unanimous?"| AS{"Enough Votes"}
    AS -->|"Yes"| P["_performSlash()"]
    AS -->|"No"| W["Waiting for More"]
    P --> F["Validator Slashed"]
    W -->|"TIMELOCK_ROLE slashValidator"| F
```

Key details:
- **Vote Expiry:** Each vote carries an `expiration` ≤ `maxSlashVoteDurationInSeconds`. Expired votes are cleaned up automatically by `_cleanupExpiredVotes` (invoked in voting & slashing paths).
- **Eligibility:** Only *active & non-slashed* validators may vote; a validator cannot vote to slash itself.
- **Cooldown Safety:** Admins must ensure `cooldownInterval > maxSlashVoteDuration` (enforced by `setCooldownInterval`). This guarantees users can always withdraw if a slash fails to pass.
- **Commission & Rewards:** Upon slashing, all stake & cooling amounts are burned; reward & commission accrual stops at `slashedAtTimestamp`.
- **Post-Slash Cleanup:** Users cannot recover losses, so admins use `adminClearValidatorRecord` / `adminBatchClearValidatorRecords` to erase orphaned state.

##### Effects of a Successful Slash

When `_performSlash` runs, the contract immediately:

1. **Burns 100 % of the validator’s stake and cooling balances.**  Both `validatorTotalStaked` and `validatorTotalCooling` are zeroed and the global aggregates (`totalStaked`, `totalCooling`) are reduced accordingly.
2. **Marks the validator as `slashed = true` and `active = false`.**  A `slashedAtTimestamp` is stored; reward logic caps accrual at this timestamp for all future calculations.
3. **Stops Reward & Commission Accrual.**  Reward‐rate calculations reference `slashedAtTimestamp`, so no new rewards or commission can accumulate after the slash block.
4. **Clears the stakers list and voting records** to prevent further interactions or double-slashing.
5. **Emits `ValidatorSlashed` and `ValidatorStatusUpdated` events** with the total stake+cooling amount burned so off-chain indexers can reconcile supply changes.

After these state changes, affected users must rely on the admin cleanup functions to remove now-irrecoverable records tied to the slashed validator.

#### Commission System

Validator commission flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant StakingContract
    participant Validator
    participant Treasury
    
    User->>StakingContract: stake(validatorId)
    Note over StakingContract: Rewards accrue over time
    
    User->>StakingContract: claim()
    StakingContract->>StakingContract: Calculate gross rewards
    StakingContract->>StakingContract: Deduct commission
    StakingContract->>StakingContract: Update validator accrued commission
    StakingContract->>Treasury: distributeReward(user, netAmount)
    Treasury->>User: Transfer net rewards
    
    Validator->>StakingContract: requestCommissionClaim()
    Note over StakingContract: 7-day timelock
    Validator->>StakingContract: finalizeCommissionClaim()
    StakingContract->>Treasury: distributeReward(validator, commission)
    Treasury->>Validator: Transfer commission
```

**Implementation:**
- Each validator keeps its **own** commission checkpoint history.  To defend against unbounded growth:
  •  `setMaxCommissionCheckpoints` caps the length (default 500).  Attempts to exceed revert with `MaxCommissionCheckpointsExceeded`.<br>  •  Admins can **prune** old data via `pruneCommissionCheckpoints` / `pruneRewardRateCheckpoints` (gas-heavy, irreversible).  Successful pruning emits `CommissionCheckpointsPruned` or `RewardRateCheckpointsPruned` respectively.
- 7-day timelock on withdrawals (COMMISSION_CLAIM_TIMELOCK)
- forceSettleValidatorCommission() for manual settlement

**Force Settlement Mechanism:**

```solidity
function forceSettleValidatorCommission(uint16 validatorId) external
```

- Permissionless function to trigger commission settlement
- Iterates all reward tokens and calculates accrued commission
- Updates validator's commission balance
- Gas costs borne by caller
- Useful before commission rate changes or validator updates

## Testing

### Running Tests
The core test suite can be run using the following Forge command, which specifically targets the `PlumeStakingDiamond` tests with high verbosity:

```bash
forge test --match-contract PlumeStakingDiamond  -vvvv --via-ir
```

### Gas Considerations

**Notice on Loop Operations:** The PlumeStaking contract's design accounts for the current operational scale. At present, the system operates with 10 validators and one primary reward token. As there are no immediate plans to scale to hundreds of validators or tens of reward tokens, functions that loop through all validators or reward tokens are computationally safe and are not expected to exceed block gas limits under these conditions. Developers should remain mindful of these looping patterns if the system's scale significantly increases in the future.
