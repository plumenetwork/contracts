# PlumeStaking

PlumeStaking is a flexible and comprehensive staking system for PLUME tokens that supports multiple validators, reward distribution, and a cooling period for unstaked tokens.

## Architecture

PlumeStaking now uses a Diamond architecture with multiple facets to organize functionality:

    style G fill:#ffc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
```

- **PlumeStaking (Diamond)**: The main entry point that implements the Diamond standard.
- **AccessControlFacet**: Manages roles and permissions.
- **StakingFacet**: Handles staking and unstaking operations.
- **RewardsFacet**: Manages reward tokens, rates, and distribution.
- **ValidatorFacet**: Handles validator management, including voting and execution of slashing.
- **ManagementFacet**: Provides administrative functions, including cleanup of records for slashed validators.
- **PlumeStakingRewardTreasury**: Separate contract for holding and distributing rewards.

## Slashing Mechanism

The system implements a slashing mechanism with the following key features:
- **Lazy Slashing / Staker-Initiated Penalty Application:** Slashing is a two-step process involving voting by active, non-slashed validators and then execution by an address with `TIMELOCK_ROLE`.
- **100% Penalty:** When a validator is slashed, 100% of their staked and cooling PLUME tokens are effectively burned (removed from circulation by reducing total supply trackers).
- **Voting Requirement:** A unanimous vote from all other active, non-slashed validators is required to slash a validator.
- **No User Recovery for Slashed Funds:** Since the penalty is 100%, users do not recover funds staked with or cooling for a validator that gets slashed.
- **Admin Cleanup:** Administrative functions (`adminClearValidatorRecord`, `adminBatchClearValidatorRecords`) are provided to clean up stale user-validator association records after a validator is slashed and their funds are accounted for as lost.
- **Operational Restrictions for Slashed Validators:**
    - Slashed validators cannot have new stake directed to them.
    - Stakers cannot unstake or restake with a slashed validator.
    - Slashed validators cannot set their commission or request/finalize commission claims.
    - Rewards stop accruing for a slashed validator from the `slashedAtTimestamp`.
- **View Function Adjustments:** View functions like `getUserValidators` and `getUserCooldowns` filter out slashed validators or their associated data.

## Treasury System

### PlumeStakingRewardTreasury

The protocol uses a dedicated upgradeable treasury contract to securely hold and distribute rewards:

- **Upgradeable Design**: Implements UUPS pattern for upgradeability with proper access control
- **Separation of Concerns**: Dedicated treasury contract for better security and fund management
- **Role-Based Access**: Implements a comprehensive role system:
  - `DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE`: Only the Diamond proxy can distribute rewards
  - `ADMIN_ROLE`: Can add reward tokens and manage other roles
  - `UPGRADER_ROLE`: Can authorize contract upgrades
  - `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: Super admin role for initial setup

### Treasury Architecture

The treasury system consists of two main components:

1. **PlumeStakingRewardTreasury**: The main implementation contract
2. **PlumeStakingRewardTreasuryProxy**: ERC1967 proxy that delegates to the implementation

This proxy pattern enables future upgrades while maintaining the same address and state.

### Reward Distribution Flow

1. Users stake their PLUME tokens to validators
2. Rewards accrue over time based on configured reward rates
3. When users claim rewards:
   - The RewardsFacet calculates earned rewards
   - The RewardsFacet (with DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE) calls the treasury
   - The treasury verifies the caller's role and transfers tokens directly to the user
